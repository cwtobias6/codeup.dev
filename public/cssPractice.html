				<h1>Live Life</h1>
				<p>Live life like it’s live.
				   No scripts stitched, no rehearsed dyes.
				   Take a breadth, and just breathe…
				   If only I’d live mine like I died in a dream.
				</p>

				<h2>To Rekindle</h2>
				<p>To rekindle an old flame you need more than a match,
				   Simple and old frames keep an image left in tact.
				   But some stories are better left unhung,
				   Yet here I sit facing the night’s sun.
				</p>

				<h3>Dear World</h3>
				<p>World,

				   Why must our suns be borne into dark,
				   Chored so young to be more than a spark.
				   If not me then let him, might just us be forgiven,
				   For our light will not strike, it just arcs…
				   …Ironic—His light is outmatched by his dark. 
				</p>

				<h3>Why write?</h3>
				<p>Through the distance, no the ignorance of the situation, we find a glimmer of a new beginning—a beacon of light that shines bright upon our dimmed view of reality, our closed section of the world. Open our eyes and see, look out upon the oceans, cross those barriers and find a curiosity, an interest, a passion, a love.
